    # The container image used to launch the Ceph daemon pods (mon, mgr, osd, mds, rgw).
    # v13 is mimic, v14 is nautilus, and v15 is octopus.
    # RECOMMENDATION: In production, use a specific version tag instead of the general v14 flag, which pulls the latest release and could result in different
    # versions running within the cluster. See tags available at https://hub.docker.com/r/ceph/ceph/tags/.
    # If you want to be more precise, you can always use a timestamp tag such ceph/ceph:v15.2.5-20200916
    # This tag might not contain a new Ceph version, just security fixes from the underlying operating system, which will reduce vulnerabilities
